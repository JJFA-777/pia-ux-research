# UX Usability Analysis Research Plan for Nigerian Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021

## Research Objective
Conduct comprehensive UX usability analysis and process mapping for the Nigerian Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 to identify accessibility barriers, process bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities across all stakeholder types.

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation Analysis (Based on Existing Data)
- [x] Review PIA document analysis (structure, entities, cross-references)
- [x] Review stakeholder mapping (5 primary categories, roles, responsibilities)
- [x] Review international benchmarking (best practices, regulatory frameworks)
- [x] Extract key UX insights from existing analyses
- [x] Identify critical user journeys and interaction points

### Phase 2: Stakeholder-Centric UX Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Create usability testing protocols for each stakeholder type
  - [x] Government/Regulatory entities (NUPRC, NMDPRA, Ministry)
  - [x] Oil and Gas Companies (upstream, midstream, downstream)
  - [x] Host Communities (individual citizens, community leaders, trust boards)
  - [x] Civil Society/Public (NGOs, academics, general public)
  - [x] International Partners (foreign investors, multilateral organizations)
- [x] 2.2 Develop stakeholder query simulations
  - [x] Information seeking scenarios
  - [x] Compliance verification scenarios
  - [x] Application/licensing scenarios
  - [x] Dispute resolution scenarios
- [x] 2.3 Assess accessibility requirements by stakeholder type

### Phase 3: Process Mapping and Flow Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Create detailed process flowcharts using Mermaid diagrams
  - [x] Licensing workflow (petroleum prospecting to mining lease)
  - [x] Compliance monitoring and enforcement workflow
  - [x] Dispute resolution workflow
  - [x] Host community fund disbursement workflow
- [x] 3.2 Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in each workflow
- [x] 3.3 Map information dependencies and cross-references

### Phase 4: Language and Accessibility Analysis
- [x] 4.1 Identify sections requiring multilingual support
  - [x] Community-facing provisions (Chapter 3 focus)
  - [x] Public information requirements
  - [x] Regulatory compliance notifications
- [x] 4.2 Assess literacy level requirements
  - [x] Technical vs. plain language analysis
  - [x] Legal complexity evaluation
  - [x] Information architecture assessment
- [x] 4.3 Evaluate digital accessibility standards compliance

### Phase 5: UX Pain Points and Optimization
- [x] 5.1 Analyze UX pain points by stakeholder type
  - [x] Information findability issues
  - [x] Process complexity challenges
  - [x] Documentation requirements burden
  - [x] Communication gaps
- [x] 5.2 Benchmark against international best practices
  - [x] Compare with Norway's integrated approach
  - [x] Analyze Brazil's ANP transparency mechanisms
  - [x] Extract lessons from Equinor's governance model
- [x] 5.3 Develop optimization recommendations

### Phase 6: Synthesis and Reporting
- [x] 6.1 Integrate findings across all analysis dimensions
- [x] 6.2 Prioritize recommendations by impact and feasibility
- [x] 6.3 Create comprehensive UX analysis report
- [x] 6.4 Final review and quality assurance

## Key Research Questions

1. **Usability**: How effectively can different stakeholders navigate and understand PIA requirements?
2. **Accessibility**: What barriers exist for stakeholders with varying literacy levels and language capabilities?
3. **Process Efficiency**: Where are the bottlenecks and inefficiencies in critical regulatory workflows?
4. **Information Architecture**: How well does the Act's structure support different user needs and tasks?
5. **Community Engagement**: Are community-facing provisions accessible to local populations?
6. **Regulatory Clarity**: Do regulatory processes provide clear guidance for compliance?
7. **International Standards**: How does Nigeria's approach compare to global best practices?

## Success Criteria

- Comprehensive usability protocols for all 5 stakeholder types
- Detailed process flowcharts for 4 critical workflows
- Clear identification of multilingual support requirements
- Evidence-based UX pain point analysis
- Actionable recommendations based on international benchmarks
- Complete accessibility assessment across literacy levels

## Deliverables

- Comprehensive UX usability analysis report (`docs/ux_usability_analysis.md`)
- Process flowcharts (embedded Mermaid diagrams)
- Stakeholder-specific usability protocols
- Multilingual support recommendations
- Accessibility compliance assessment
- Optimization roadmap based on international best practices
