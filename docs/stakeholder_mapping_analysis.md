# Nigerian Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021: Comprehensive Stakeholder Mapping Analysis

## Executive Summary

The Nigerian Petroleum Industry Act (PIA) 2021 establishes a comprehensive stakeholder ecosystem with clearly defined roles, responsibilities, and interaction mechanisms. This analysis identifies five primary stakeholder categories: Government/Regulators, Oil and Gas Companies, Host Communities, Civil Society/Public, and International Partners. The Act creates sophisticated governance frameworks through the Nigerian Upstream Regulatory Commission (NURC) and Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA), establishes mandatory host community development trusts funded by 3% of annual operating expenditures, and implements progressive fiscal terms with hydrocarbon tax rates of 15-30% depending on location and lease type[5]. The framework incorporates international best practices including multi-stakeholder governance models similar to EITI requirements[1], comprehensive stakeholder engagement protocols aligned with IFC Performance Standards[2], and transparent licensing processes following API community engagement guidelines[3].

## 1. Introduction

The Nigerian Petroleum Industry Act 2021 represents a fundamental transformation of Nigeria's petroleum sector governance, establishing new institutional frameworks and stakeholder relationships. This comprehensive analysis maps the complex web of stakeholders created by the Act, their specific roles and obligations, regulatory oversight mechanisms, fiscal terms, and community engagement frameworks. The analysis incorporates international best practices to provide context and recommendations for effective implementation.

**Multi-Stakeholder Oversight**: Like EITI requirements, the PIA establishes multi-stakeholder groups through the host communities development trust structure, involving government (regulators), companies (settlors), and civil society (community representatives)[1][5].

**Transparency Requirements**: The Act mandates public registers, beneficial ownership disclosure, and financial reporting similar to EITI transparency standards[1][5].

**Systematic Disclosure**: Regular reporting requirements and public accessibility of information align with EITI's systematic disclosure principles[1].

#### 6.1.2 IFC Performance Standards Alignment

The PIA framework demonstrates alignment with IFC Performance Standards[2]:

**Stakeholder Engagement (PS1)**: The Act requires meaningful consultation with host communities and establishes formal engagement mechanisms[2][5].

**Community Health and Safety (PS4)**: Field development plans must include health and safety provisions for communities[2][5].

**Indigenous Peoples Considerations**: While not explicitly addressing indigenous peoples, the framework provides for community consultation and consent processes[2].

### 6.2 Regulatory Framework Comparisons
